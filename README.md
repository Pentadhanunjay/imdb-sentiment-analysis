# IMDb Sentiment Analysis Project 🎬📊

This project performs **Sentiment Analysis on the IMDb Movie Review Dataset** using a combination of traditional ML and modern optimization techniques.

## 🚀 Features Included

### ✅ Preprocessing
- HTML tag removal, punctuation cleaning, lowercasing
- Custom stopword removal (based on 50 most frequent words)
- Noisy review filtering (based on length and repetition)

### ✅ Feature Extraction
- TF-IDF vectorization with unigrams and bigrams
- Top 10,000 vocabulary features

### ✅ Modeling
- **Logistic Regression with L1** for feature selection
- **XGBoost**, tuned via **Bayesian Optimization (Optuna)**
- **Linear SVM**
- Final model is an **Ensemble (VotingClassifier)** combining all three

### ✅ Evaluation
- **Stratified 5-Fold Cross-Validation**
- F1-score as the primary metric

### ✅ Interpretability
- Shows **Top 5 misclassified reviews**
- Displays **top contributing words** to the misclassification

## 🧠 Insights

- Combining interpretable models (LR) with powerful learners (XGBoost, SVM) improves robustness.
- Cleaning noisy data and removing dominant stopwords has a measurable impact on performance.
- Bayesian optimization outperforms grid search for XGBoost hyperparameter tuning.
